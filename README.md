# Yammer-Case-Study
1. Investigating a Drop in User Engagement
2. Understanding Search Functionality



### Description
These are the case studies provided by MODE SQL Tutorial. I finished it under python `pandasql` API so the major queries were done by SQL. This API can returns pandas dataframe thus it's very convinient on visualizing data after extracting data.
The first one is about investiagting drop of engagement from July to August, 2014. I conducted several analysis, including time, email types, major events, users activity and region. Later I drew conclusions on what I've found and made recommendations for further analysis.
The second one is to analyze whether there exists problems on 'search' function within Yammer. I looked into users search behaviors, click through and search results, and conclude that the recommended search results should be re-ordering based on users preferences.



### Major Libraries
- pandas: to manage .csv files and dataframes more conviniently
- pandasql: run SQL query under pandas dataframe, it will return table as dataframe so it's easy to draw plots on top of that
- matplotlib: data visualization



### More...
- I referenced sample ideas from Mode.com and columnist from medium.com
- It is definetly more convinient, easier and faster to manipulate data directly in pandas, not sqlite...but a very good practice of JOIN, GROUP BY and WINDOW FUNCTIONs in SQL
