# Yammer-Case-Study
Investigating a Drop in User Engagement



### Description
This is the first case study from MODE SQL Tutorial. It is about investiagting drop of engagement from July to August, 2014. I conducted several analysis, including time, email types, major events, users activity and region. Later I drew conclusions on what I've found and made recommendations for further analysis.

I finished it using python because it's very convinient on visualizing data, and major analyze queries were done by SQL. 



### Major Libraries
- pandas: to manage .csv files and dataframes more conviniently
- pandasql: run SQL query under pandas dataframe, it will return table as dataframe so it's easy to draw plots on top of that
- matplotlib: data visualization



### More...
- I referenced Terence S and Jodi Zhang from Medium.com
- It is definetly more convinient and easier to manipulate data directly in pandas, not sqlite haha...
